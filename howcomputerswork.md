# how do computers work?
## what makes a computer, a computer?
it all started when humans started thinking of machines to help them with the thinking work as it helped them with the manual work!, so the pioneers of computer science explored how to design a "thinking machine" with a four different tasks, which was:
* take input
input is what you oreder or type to the computre to do either with the keyboard, mouse, microphone, camera and recently it might listen to your heartbeat through the computer on your wrist (smartwatch).
* store information 
the given inputs are stored in the memory.
* process it
the computer's processor takes information from memory, manipulates it using algorithm (a series of commands), then send's it back to the memory with the applied modifications and ready for the output.
* output the results
depending on what a computer is designed to do the output can be either in text, photos, videos or interactive games. when two computers connect over the internet, the output becomes an input for the other.
computers may be in many shapes, sizes and types but these four tasks is the basics for any computer and that's what makes a computer, a computer !

# Data & Binary
all the informations in the computer are carried by electric wires and circuits, on a single wire we can represent a YES or NO, ON or OFF, TRUE or FALSE and 1 or 0 which is called a bit (the smallest piece of information a computer can store), the more the zero's and one's the more the bits.
the binary system represents the numbers 0 and 1, any number can be represented by 0 or 1 or by bunch of wires that are on or off, the more the wires the larger the numbers.
when it comes to other types of information (text, images or sounds) they're also represented by 0 1 .
in text every litter is assigned to a numebr or combination of zero's and one's
in images every pixel has a color, each of the colors can be represented with numbers.
in sounds, every vibration is represented graphically as a waveform and any point of this waveform is represented by a number.
these zero's and one's are the backbone of the basic four tasks of the computer.

# circiuts & logic
the computer uses millions of teeny electronic components that come together to form circuits that modifies and combine the input signals in order to process it and makes it an output.
it does that by taking the electrical signal , on or of, and flips it.
more complicated circuits can take multiple signals and combine them to give different result.
the adder circuittakes in two bits and adds them together to calculate the sum, you can put multiple adder circuits side by side to add much larger numbers, all the information processing your computer does is just lots of small simple operations put together.
the smaller the circuit is, the less distance the electrical signal has to go which makes it the smaller the faster.

# MEMORY, CPU, INPUT & OUTPUT
as we sead earlier the journey of the information is to enter the computer as an input by multiple ways which converts your order into numbers which is sent as binary into the computer, then the CPU calculates it by requesting a step by step instructions from memory that tell's it how to display the output, and the CPU runs these instructions and stores the results in memory, at the end this information is sent in binary to the output device that converts the binary signals into the requested style, whither it was a screen, a speaker or even a printer, your output will be ready for you in bits of a second.

# Hardware & Software 
the Hardware is the physical device's you see in your own eyes such as wires, speakers, plugs etc...
but the software are the programs or codes that runs inside the machine and you dont see it.
they connect with each other through the CPU, the CPU recives commands that tell it which circuit to use for a specific job, and it will simply do it for you.
so the software tells the CPU what to do but the master program that manages how software uses the Hardware of the computer is the operating system, that has the ability to control the other software on the computer.
although the computer is much faster that us "humans" but the thing that makes a computer useful or smart is us, by coding and writing software that turns ideas into reality, and that gives us the ultimate power of creating useful and efficient things to make a better world.
