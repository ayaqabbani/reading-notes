# process & design
before creating a website you need to know who's your target audiene, you target them indivisually like the age, gender or country. or you can target companies  like a relative department or job position.
beside that you need to know why they will want to visit your website according to the information you'll provide.
so first you need to target your audience.
why they visit your website.
what information you'll provide to them.
and then you're all set to start the work.
## site maps
a site map is a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site, the website should have a map to help you organize the information into sections or pages.
like a house with rooms every door will get you to different room, and this is how the site map works each page leads into another. for example when you're at the home page you'll have the ability to access one of the other pages that is placed on the home page like "about", "articles", "shop" etc...
depending on your page elemnts and so on.
## wireframes
a wireframe is considered to be the scratch of a website's interface, its the sketch that's used in early stage's of the web design, its created in only black and white to help you get a basic picture of what the website will contain at the end. for example :
![wireframe](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R39cfed23cc81bffc3180e161c8d81da5?rik=AjRhHk1pddjbsg&riu=http%3a%2f%2fmmls.mmu.edu.my%2fwordpress%2f1151103126%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2fsites%2f30365%2f2017%2f09%2fSimple-Wireframe-2.jpg&ehk=Qd8ZxXCzNHJb%2fPPMvCYdP6OZVsfkKqebJAyvviq%2bXzQ%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw)
don't worry it's just the beginning of it, it just need a little arranging, styling and coloring and it will come alive!.
