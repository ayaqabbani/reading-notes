# CSS
## what is the CSS
its a tool that helps us to do modifications to the HTML page we did earlier by using some rules that is made up of selectors which the element of the rule, and declarations that indicates what will they look like.
 ## HTML with CSS
 CSS associates style rules with HTML elements, that will achive the final display of the elements and contents.

 the CSS rule contains two parts :

 *selector
 *declaration

 the selector indicates which element the rule applies to ( can be used on multiple elements)

 the declaration indicates how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled.

 for example :  p {
     font-family: arial}

     the p is the selector

     the {font-family:arial} is the declaration

## displayed elements
CSS properties affect how elements are displayed , and it works by sitting the declarations inside curly brackets that devides in two parts

*a property : indicates the aspects of the element.
*a value : specify the settings you want to apply to the properties.

as for the example we took earlier :

  {font-family:  will be the property.

  arial}   would be the value.
